## Project Overview
This project focused on the temperatures in June and December and looked at various statistics between the two periods to assess whether the weather conditions were suitable for the ice cream/surf shop to operate.

## Results

1) The average temperature from June to December is 75 degrees and 71 degrees respectively, which is moderate from an average point of view, with little change between the two periods.
2) Maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also remarkable similar.
3) Minimum temperatures of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variation. This reflects the much lower temperature levels in December, which may not be suitable for ice cream and surfing. However, we would expect slightly more variation in the December numbers, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December).

## Summary
Overall, December and June weather are historically very similar, but the range of results in December is wider, with highs closer to June and lows well below June.

 Additional queries you can run include looking at the difference in precipitation between June and December to see if it's wetter, or comparing by weather station. This is because different locations can see high and low temperatures and precipitation. I'm primarily interested in the weather station closest to my estimated location. This narrows down the results and provides the best data that can be considered.
